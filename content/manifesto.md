We at FRENS believe that staking should be easy, fun, social, and decentralized.

Our mission is to enable groups of friends to start staking Ethereum. We bring opportunities for staking to communities who may not have the financial means to do so but want to contribute to the network and reap its rewards.

Instead of being just another staking pool, FRENS will be a staking pool factory - allowing you and your friends to create your own staking pools. 

With FRENS, staking becomes easy and fun. Our web-app allows you to create your own staking pool with just a few clicks. Our smart contracts ensure that your staking is safe and secure.

We plan to achieve this through several stages:
1. Developing a set of smart contracts that allow groups of friends to collect the necessary funds to bootstrap a new validator.
1. Creating a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to create and fund their own validators, and monitor their performance.
1. Issuing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to each participant, allowing them to hold or trade their positions in a staking pool.
1. Implementing Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) solutions to protect and improve efficiency of their validators
1. Educating users and promoting the values of decentralization, whether they are operators or stakers.
1. Creating a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to sustain the efforts of the FRENS project.

We believe that Ethereum has the potential to be the backbone of a new era of collaboration and cooperation between people. With FRENS, we aim to change the world for the better by contributing to the success of the Ethereum network.
